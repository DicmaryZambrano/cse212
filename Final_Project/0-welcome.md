# Python Data Structure Tutorial

Welcome to the Python Data Structure Tutorial! As a beginning Python programmer, it's important to have a strong foundation in basic data structures. In this tutorial, we'll cover three essential topics:

- [Queues](1-topic.md).
- [Linked Lists](2-topic.md).
- [Binary Search Trees](3-topic.md).

Throughout each module, we'll provide clear descriptions and examples to help you understand these concepts. But we won't stop there â€“ at the end of each module, we'll challenge you with a problem to solve on your own. We strongly encourage you to attempt these problems before looking at the solution. This will help you solidify your understanding of the material and prepare you for more complex data structures down the road.

Let's get started!
